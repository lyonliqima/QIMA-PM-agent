# PRD Template — QIMA Standard (Draft Version)

Extracted from `qima-prd-writing-guide` and adapted for the `write-prd` skill. Length budget: no more than 250 body lines or 6 Confluence pages. Technical implementation detail belongs in Appendix or Tech Design.

---

## How to Use This Template

Replace these placeholders:

- `{{FIELD}}` — single-value placeholder.
- `{{LIST:item-kind}}` — repeat this row or bullet once per item.
- `Open question — <text>` — unresolved item surfaced in Checkpoint A.
- `<!-- IMG:filename.png -->` — optional Figma image marker for Phase 4.

Voice rules:

- PM voice. No repo names, service names, API paths, field names, commits, branches, PRs, or implementation jargon.
- At most 3 Jira ticket references in the whole document, all in Section 1 or Appendix.
- Stakeholders should be team + lead, not repo lists.
- If technical detail is required, link to Tech Design or move it to Appendix.

Formatting:

- Use Markdown headings and pipe tables.
- Keep paragraphs to 3 lines or fewer.
- Use inline links: `[label](url)`.
- Do not use HTML tables, inline CSS, decorative callouts, or gradient headings.

If a section truly has no content, keep the heading and write:

> Not applicable for this release — reason: {{REASON}}.

Three bold-lead-in paragraphs, each citing one source:

1. **{{Pain 1 short label}}**: {{evidence + 1-line implication}}

# 5. Requirements (Mandatory)

**Priority definitions**:

- **P0** = required for MVP and v1 launch.
- **P1** = fast follow, usually within one sprint after v1.
- **P2** = architecture reserve or future scope.

## 5.1 Functional Requirements and Priority

No more than 12 rows total.

| ID | Function | Priority | Description / Notes |

| **FR-1** | {{1-line function name}} | P0 | {{no more than 2 sentences describing what users see or can do; do not describe APIs or fields}} |

If FRs naturally group into 2-3 modules, use sub-headings such as `### 5.1.1 Module A — {name}` and keep each module table to 6 rows or fewer.

## 5.2 Out of Scope

| Item | Reason |
| --- | --- |

No more than 8 rows. Each row is one deferred or excluded item plus the reason.

# 6. Design

No more than 3 sentences.

> **Figma frame**: [{{page-1-name}}]({{full Figma URL with ?node-id=<frame-id>}})

{{full Figma URL on its own line for the Figma for Confluence plugin}}

Rule: each Section 6.x page must include the text deep link and the same bare URL on its own line. If the node ID cannot be resolved inside the provided section, write `> **Figma frame**: TBD — not in section; ask design lead` and add it to Section 11.1.

## 6.2 Page 2 — {{name}}

Repeat per page. Keep to 4 pages or fewer.

## 6.3 Key Interaction Specs

| Element | Interaction | Behavior |

---

# 11. Open Questions & Next Steps (Optional — usually keep)

## 11.1 Open Questions

| # | Question | Owner to answer | Blocks v1? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | {{question}} | {{name}} | {{No, but affects ...}} or **Yes — {{reason}}** |

| Decision | Option A | Option B | Chosen | Reasoning | Reopen trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

---

## Appendix C — For Engineering Reference (Optional — only if PM explicitly wants it)

Default: do not write this section. If the PRD contains route, field, service-name, or implementation details that the PM wants to preserve, move them here and keep the main body in business language.

In most cases, write: `See [Tech Design]({{link}})` instead of copying technical detail into the PRD.

_Document complete. {{1-sentence next action by document owner}}_
```

## Notes for the Agent

1. Hard length cap: no more than 250 body lines. If exceeded, cut Sections 5, 6, and 7 first.
2. Voice gate: before publishing, scan against `voice-and-register.md`.
3. Never invent citations. Unsupported claims become Open Questions in Section 11.1.
4. IMG markers must match filenames exactly if used.
5. Default: drop Section 7 and Appendix C unless the PM explicitly wants them.
