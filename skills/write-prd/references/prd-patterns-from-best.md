## Pattern 1 · Parallel state machines per entity (strengthens D1)

When the feature involves a workflow with multiple entities (Report, FP, Test, Department, PDF, Order, etc.), do NOT collapse states into one timeline. Enumerate **one state machine per entity** with explicit transitions and triggers.

**Template** (per entity):

| From state | Trigger | To state | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial | user submits draft | Awaiting submission | notify reviewer X |
| Awaiting submission | reviewer approves | Under review | lock fields A,B |
| Under review | reviewer rejects | Requires resubmission | unlock + email submitter |

**Pass criterion**: every state listed in D1's 7-state checklist is reachable via at least one labeled transition; every transition names its trigger AND side effects.

**Origin**: QIMAlabs PRD §5.4.2 — separate state machines for Report / FP / Test / Department / PDF.

## Pattern 2 · Scenario matrix as primary AC form (strengthens AC quality)

For any FR involving an algorithm, distribution, allocation, calculation, or branching logic, the AC SHOULD be a table where each row is one edge case with the exact expected output — not just one Given/When/Then.

**Template**:

| # | Scenario | Inputs | Expected output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | even split | 4 inspectors, 8 reports, all eligible | I1→[R1,R2], I2→[R3,R4], I3→[R5,R6], I4→[R7,R8] | round-robin |
| 2 | odd split | 3 inspectors, 8 reports | I1→3, I2→3, I3→2 | remainder to first N |
| 3 | one inspector ineligible (MD=0) | 3 inspectors, 1 has MD=0 | skip ineligible; 2 active | log skip reason |
| 4 | all ineligible | all MD=0 | no assignment + alert | route to manual queue |
| 5 | inspectors > reports | 5 inspectors, 2 reports | first 2 get 1 each; rest idle | no error |
| 6 | zero reports | N inspectors, 0 reports | no-op | not an error state |

**Pass criterion**: matrix covers at minimum — happy path, boundary (0, max, +1), partial-eligibility, all-ineligible, asymmetry (more A than B and vice versa).

**Origin**: IRP Inspector Sync "Expected Results" 9-row table.

## Pattern 3 · Cross-system field handoff table (strengthens D3 + D5)

When the FR involves data crossing system boundaries (System A → System B), add a **handoff table** distinct from the in-page UI field-mapping table. List exactly what is sent, in what version, with field-name differences between sender and receiver explicit.

**Template**:

| Field (sender) | Field (receiver) | Type | Required | Release | Default if missing | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `aims.fileNameCode` | `qimalabs.report.code` | string | Y | Nov-25 | reject | code only — full name in separate field |
| `aims.fileFullName` | `qimalabs.report.displayName` | string | N | Nov-25 | use `code` | UI display |
| `aims.reportType` | `qimalabs.report.type` | enum | Y | Nov-25 | reject | values: A/B/C |
| `aims.accreditation` | `qimalabs.report.accreditation` | array | N | Jul-25 (later) | empty array | added in Jul release |

**Pass criterion**: every cross-system handoff names the sending and receiving field paths separately, marks release version, and specifies missing-value behavior.

**Origin**: QIMAlabs PRD §5.2 + §5.4.3 — November vs July release column delineation.

## Pattern 4 · Out-of-Scope with re-inclusion trigger (strengthens D6)

OOS items must be POSITIVELY stated AND each carries a **re-inclusion trigger** — the condition under which it would come back into scope. This converts the OOS list from a static fence into a roadmap.

**Template**:

> **Out of this FR**:
> - **(a) myQIMA client view of package charge** — Phase 1 internal-only. *Re-include trigger*: client billing tier rolls out (target Phase 2, Q3'26).
> - **(b) NetSuite invoice sync** — manual export only. *Re-include trigger*: NYCE confirms package line-item must appear on NS invoice.
> - **(c) Sample Size Balancing in inspector allocation** — deferred. *Reasons*: (1) no stakeholder consensus, (2) low-frequency edge case, (3) Pierre's recommendation, (4) ~5–7 dev-day cost not justified at current volume.

**Pass criterion**: every OOS bullet either (a) lists a concrete re-inclusion trigger OR (b) lists ≥ 2 reasons it's deferred. Single-line "out of scope: X" without justification fails.

**Origin**: Package Charge §5.2 + Inspector Sync "Out of Scope" section.

## Pattern 5 · Decision log with options considered

At the end of the PRD (or at the end of any FR with material ambiguity), add a **§ Decisions** section recording alternatives that were considered and rejected. One entry per material decision.

**Template**:

> **Decision D-1 · Translation insertion point**
> - **Option A** — translate JSON before assembly into Word. Pros: cheaper, reusable across templates. Cons: loses Word-specific formatting hints.
> - **Option B** — translate the assembled Word file. Pros: preserves formatting. Cons: 3× cost per page; harder to cache.
> - **Chosen**: **Option A**. *Reasoning*: CN bilingual is mandatory (Tier-1 lab market); ~80% of DE reports are bilingual; cost dominates over formatting fidelity at current volumes.
> - **Reopen trigger**: complaint rate on formatting > 5% post-launch.

**Pass criterion**: any FR where the team considered alternatives has an entry. Entries name options, pros/cons, the chosen option WITH reasoning, and a reopen trigger.

**Origin**: Multilingual Report PRD §12.

## Pattern 6 · Three independent Release Gates (Tech / Business / Data)

Migration / integration / data-pipeline PRDs MUST split release gates into at least three independent sign-offs, each with a distinct signer. Single "ready to launch?" gate hides the failure modes that actually kill these projects (most often: data migration quality).

**Template** (Rollout & Release Plan section):

> ### Release Gates
>
> 1. **Tech Gate** (Dev + QA) — all P0 FRs pass; performance baselines met (load order < 2s, action < 500ms); hardware/integration spike resolved.
> 2. **Business Gate** (Product Owner + business lead + lab/site manager) — UAT sign-off; ≥ 5 sample orders processed end-to-end with no discrepancy vs legacy.
> 3. **Data Gate** (PM + data owner) — config-table migration verified; downstream consumers (analysis software, reporting module) successfully read the new data; ≥ 50 records compared against legacy with zero diff.

**Pass criterion**: at least 3 gates with distinct signers; each gate has a falsifiable pass condition (numbers or named artifacts), not "looks good".

**When to apply**: any PRD where (a) data migration is involved, (b) hardware/external system integration, (c) the feature replaces an existing tool/workflow.

**Origin**: Sample weighing & labeling PRD §10.3.

## Pattern 7 · Open Question blocking flag

Every entry in §11 Open Questions MUST be marked **Blocks v1: yes / no**, with a designated answerer. "Yes" rows convert into a pre-kickoff must-resolve checklist; "no" rows can ship as TBD.

**Template**:

| # | Question | Answerer | Blocks v1? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Frequency of AIMS test name → ShortName mapping changes? | Simple + Eric | No, but affects FR-C1 design granularity |
| Q2 | SH / DG scope differences vs HZ — what configs need exposing? | Simple (SH visit) + Eric (DG) | **Yes — required before dev kickoff** |
| Q3 | Web-driver path for local hardware (balance serial / printer): agent vs WebSerial vs hybrid? | Dev + Simple | **Yes — affects FR-B5 / B13 estimate** |
| Q4 | Does current Breakdown schema support multi-version? | Dev | **Yes — affects FR-A9 estimate** |
| Q5 | Business acceptance of removing mix→split? | PM + PO | No, affects switchover resistance |

**Pass criterion**: every OQ row has both an answerer and a Blocks-v1 flag. ≥ 1 row marked **Yes** is the norm — if every OQ is "no", something is being hidden or the PM hasn't probed hard enough.

**Anti-pattern**: a long OQ list with no flagging → reads like decoration, not a checklist.

**Origin**: Sample weighing & labeling PRD §11.1.

## Pattern 8 · Decision provenance (meeting-source attribution)

Every material OOS, deferral, or controversial design call carries a one-line attribution to the source meeting/decision-maker. This converts the PRD from a static doc into an audit trail — future PMs can see WHY before re-litigating.

**Template** (in OOS rationale or Appendix B "Decisions captured"):

> - **Mix → split removed**: PM noted *"not writing back to AIMS is actually problematic"*; SME confirmed current tool also doesn't write back. Conclusion: remove from v1, revisit after compliance alignment. (Source: 2026-04-20 review meeting)
> - **Data sheet auto-print removed**: Business lead stated *"we will not print data sheets"*; PM confirmed direction is electronic data sheet (Phase 2 reporting closed loop). (Source: same meeting)
> - **Sub-sample / sub-sub-sample**: SME-A confirmed Chemistry has no such concept; SME-B confirmed Physical/Textile does — separate scope. (Source: same meeting)

**Pass criterion**: every OOS row in §5.2 either (a) has inline attribution, or (b) is referenced from a "Decisions captured" appendix. Bare exclusions without provenance fail.

**Why it matters**: 6 months later, when someone asks "why didn't we do mix→split?", the answer must not require Slack archaeology.

**Origin**: Sample weighing & labeling PRD Appendix B.

## How these slot into the workflow

## Patterns 9–13 · Behavior-change / email / conversion-flow PRDs

> **Scope tag**: Patterns 9–13 apply ONLY to PRDs about user behavior change — email campaigns, conversion-rate work, UX copy, flow simplification, churn-feedback. Do NOT apply to functional / data / integration PRDs (use Patterns 1–8 instead). For PRDs that are mixed, apply both sets to their respective sections.

### Pattern 9 · Psychology-first structure

For behavior-change PRDs, the §2 Background or a dedicated "Goal Breakdown" section MUST lead with a **psychological motivation table** before the FR list. Each motivation row pairs a real-world user thought with the design lever that addresses it.

**Template**:

| # | User's true psychological motivation | Inner monologue | Why they choose to delay / refuse | Implication for design (copy / UX) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | I'm not the final decision-maker; booking carries risk | "If I book now, will I be held accountable?" | Silence = no decision responsibility | State explicitly this is a *standard, low-risk action*; not a personal call |
| 2 | I'm afraid this is a sales entry point | "If I respond, will sales target me?" | Avoiding uncontrollable conversation | Clear: *no sales follow-up triggered* |
| 3 | Not urgent, delay is safe | "Cert still valid, no one is pushing" | B2B priority — non-urgent gets pushed | Provide a *gentle time anchor* with a reason |
| 4 | I overestimate the cost | "Could take half a day to prep" | Black-box cost fear | State: *2 minutes, no preparation needed* |
| 5 | Once started, can't stop | "Can I cancel? Reschedule?" | B2B fear of irreversibility | Give a clear out: *cancel/reschedule anytime* |
| 6 | Silence is safest | "Doing nothing offends no one" | Silence = no record, no process | Make *the button safer than silence* |

**Pass criterion**: ≥ 5 distinct motivations, each paired with a specific design lever. "Users don't engage" is not a motivation — that's the symptom.

**Origin**: Audit Renew PRD (Confluence 4531159117) §1 Goal Breakdown.

### Pattern 10 · Multi-lever improvement matrix

For behavior-change PRDs, when proposing concrete improvements, structure them by **lever** — not by feature. Standard levers: **Copywriting / Interaction Design / Visual / Mechanism**. Each row has Action / Reason for change / Key principle / Expected outcome.

**Template**:

| Lever | Specific Action | Reason for change | Key principle | Expected outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Copy** | Change "Reject" label → "Not Renewing / Help Us Improve" | "Reject" is confrontational | Weaken rejection semantics | Higher willingness to express true intent |
| **Copy** | State next to button: "does not affect cert validity, no sales follow-up" | Users avoid the unknown | Eliminate uncertainty | Reduce hesitation |
| **Interaction** | One-click completion (no login, no required fields) | Long flows cause drop-off | Minimize friction | Significant CTR lift |
| **Interaction** | Reasons collected in step 2, optional | Mandatory input causes abandonment | Don't block main path | Core action preserved |
| **Visual** | Reject as clear secondary button (not hidden) | Reject often visually weakened | Respect user choice | More authentic feedback |
| **Visual** | Booking + Reject side by side | Users assume Booking is the only "right" answer | Transparent decision | Higher trust |
| **Mechanism** | Auto-stop reminders after Reject | Users fear ignored input | Reward feedback | More users willing to click |
| **Mechanism** | Reject is NOT a negative KPI for Sales/CS | Internal incentives → aggressive follow-up | Align org and user goals | Authentic long-term data |

**Pass criterion**: at least 2 actions per lever × 4 levers (≥ 8 actions); every row has all 4 columns filled.

**Why these 4 levers**: copy fixes wording; interaction fixes the click path; visual fixes attention/hierarchy; mechanism fixes the incentive structure. Most behavior PRDs only address 1–2 levers and miss the remaining failure modes.

**Origin**: Audit Renew PRD §2 (Streamlining Reject Feedback).

### Pattern 11 · Solution comparison with selection rule

When the PRD presents 2+ candidate solutions, the comparison table must be paired with an **explicit selection rule** stated above the table — not buried in the conclusion. Reader sees the rule, picks their priority, knows the answer.

**Template** (above the comparison table):

> - If **maximum compatibility and response rate** are the priority → **Solution 1**
> - If **interaction quality and confirmation** matter more → **Solution 3**
> - If **immediate response + safety net** matter more → **Solution 4 (Hybrid)**

| Solution | Implementation | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. One-click via email links | Each option = hyperlink with embedded params; backend records on click | Works in all email clients; lowest friction; high response | No second confirmation; misclick risk; limited granularity |
| 2. AMP for Email | Interactive forms inside email body | True in-email interaction; better UX for short feedback | Very limited client support (Gmail/Yahoo only); high cost |
| 3. Email trigger + web feedback page | Email shows entry point; click redirects to web page with prefilled context | Confirmation, edit, richer feedback; consistent across clients | Extra step (page load); slight drop-off |
| 4. Hybrid (1-click capture + optional confirmation) | One-click in email + lightweight web flow for confirmation/expansion | Maximum response + correctable | Higher impl cost; redirection step |

**Pass criterion**: ≥ 2 solutions; explicit selection rule above the table; advantages/disadvantages columns balanced (no straw-man options).

**Anti-pattern**: comparing 4 solutions and concluding "we picked Solution 1" without the rule. The rule is what makes the comparison reusable when priorities shift.

**Origin**: Audit Renew PRD § Solution Comparison.

### Pattern 12 · Copy-ready content (not described content)

For PRDs that ship copy (email body, page text, error messages, button labels), the PRD body MUST contain the **fully written copy** with placeholders, not prose descriptions of what the copy should say. The standard is: an engineer can paste the block into the template engine without rewriting.

**Template** (per email):

> | **Subject** | `{{AuditReportNumber}}` — schedule your Audit Renewal in ~2 minutes (recommended before `{{AuditRecommendedBookingDate}}`) |
> |---|---|
> | **Preview text** | Standard renewal. No documents needed. Reschedule/cancel anytime. No sales follow-up. |
> | **Body** | Hi `{{AuditRecipientName}}`, ... [full body with placeholders] ... |
> | **Primary CTA** | Schedule Audit Renewal |
> | **Secondary action** | Not Renewing / Pause reminders |

For UX page copy, structure as a copy table:

> | Section | Suggested Copy |
> |---|---|
> | Page title | **Not Renewing — Thanks for letting us know** |
> | Lead | We've recorded your choice and paused future renewal reminders for this certificate. This does not affect your current certificate validity. |
> | Confirmation banner | Saved. Your reminder settings have been updated. |
> | Reasons header | Optional: What's the main reason you're not renewing? |
> | Reason options | Price too high / Pending decision / No longer required / Switched provider / Business closed / Wrong contact / Other |
> | Buttons | Done (primary) · Schedule renewal (secondary) · Resume reminders (secondary) |

**Pass criterion**: every shippable string is in the PRD with placeholder syntax; no "TBD copy" or "marketing to write" placeholders for v1 launch text.

**Anti-pattern**: "Email subject should mention urgency and the deadline" — not testable, not shippable. Replace with the actual subject line.

**Origin**: Audit Renew PRD § Solution 1 / Solution 3 email tables.

### Pattern 13 · Mermaid flowchart per solution

For PRDs proposing alternative flows (Solution A vs Solution B), embed a **Mermaid flowchart per solution** directly in the PRD body, with dashed-note annotations on key trade-off points. Confluence renders Mermaid natively; lighter than Figma; engineering can read directly.

**Template**:

````
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User receives renewal email] --> B{Choose an action}
    B -->|Schedule Audit Renewal| C[Open booking page]
    C --> C1[User schedules]
    C1 --> Z[End]
    B -->|Not Renewing reason link| D[Email link carries params: report, token, choice, reason]
    D --> E[Backend records immediately]
    E --> F[Thank-you page]
    F --> Z

    %% trade-off annotations
    E -.-> N1[No second confirmation]
    E -.-> N2[Hard to undo / misclick risk]
```
````

**Pass criterion**: one chart per solution; trade-off annotations (`-.-> N1[...]`) called out on the diverging nodes; chart matches the corresponding email/copy block in the PRD body.

**When to apply**: any time the PRD compares 2+ flows. Skip if there's only one flow.

**Origin**: Audit Renew PRD § Other Information.

## How these slot into the workflow

- **Phase 4 drafting**: when writing each FR / section, consult these 13 patterns and apply whichever fit
  - **Functional / data / integration PRDs (use 1–8)**:
    - Workflow FR → Pattern 1 (state machines)
    - Algorithm/allocation FR → Pattern 2 (scenario matrix)
    - Integration FR → Pattern 3 (cross-system table)
    - Every FR with OOS → Pattern 4 (OOS with trigger)
    - Material trade-off → Pattern 5 (decision log)
    - Migration / integration / hardware PRD → Pattern 6 (3 release gates)
    - Section 11 (OQ) → Pattern 7 (blocking flag)
    - Every OOS row → Pattern 8 (provenance)
  - **Behavior-change / email / conversion-flow PRDs (use 9–13)**:
    - §2 Background / Goal Breakdown → Pattern 9 (psychology table)
    - Improvement section → Pattern 10 (4-lever matrix)
    - Multiple candidate solutions → Pattern 11 (selection rule + comparison)
    - Any shippable copy → Pattern 12 (copy-ready blocks)
    - Alternative flows → Pattern 13 (Mermaid per solution)
- **Phase 4.5 depth-gate**: D1 / D3 / D5 / D6 explicitly upgraded to require these patterns where applicable — see `depth-gate-checklist.md`.

## How to detect the PRD type

A PRD is a **behavior-change PRD** if any of these hold:
- Primary KPI is a conversion / response / opt-in / opt-out rate
- The deliverable is email copy, UX copy, or a decision flow (not a data model or integration)
- The user's "problem" is psychological friction (delay, fear, silence) — not a missing feature
- Success looks like *"users do X more often"*, not *"feature X exists"*

Otherwise treat as functional. When in doubt, apply both pattern sets to the appropriate sections.

## Anti-patterns (auto-fail in depth-gate)

**Functional pattern fails**:
- "Out of scope: client view" with no trigger or reason → Pattern 4 fail
- One Given/When/Then for an algorithm FR with > 3 input dimensions → Pattern 2 fail
- "Sends data to QIMAOne" without naming the fields and release version → Pattern 3 fail
- A workflow FR that lists "states: pending, done" without transitions → Pattern 1 fail
- A material trade-off resolved in Slack but not recorded in the PRD → Pattern 5 fail
- Single "Release Gate" or "Ready to ship?" check on a migration/integration PRD → Pattern 6 fail
- Open Questions section with no Blocks-v1 column → Pattern 7 fail
- OOS table with bare exclusions, no attribution to who/when decided → Pattern 8 fail

**Behavior-change pattern fails**:
- Behavior-change PRD that opens with FR table instead of a psychology section → Pattern 9 fail
- Improvement list grouped by feature rather than by lever → Pattern 10 fail
- Solution comparison concluding with "we picked X" without an explicit selection rule → Pattern 11 fail
- "Email subject should be catchy and mention urgency" instead of the actual subject line → Pattern 12 fail
- Two candidate flows compared in prose only, no diagram → Pattern 13 fail
